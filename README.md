# odin-library

This project is to practice working with objects and corresponding fields of JavaScript.\
The goal is to create a small library app, where you can add / remove books, change status to read / unread and see simple statistics such as a total amount of books, an amount of read books, etc.\
Of course, HTML and CSS will be used as well, but nothing new of these languages will be brought.\
